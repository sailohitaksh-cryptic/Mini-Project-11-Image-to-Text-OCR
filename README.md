### Output:

Their drawbacks

Despise being favored in the past, these 2 activation functions are
less used today, especially when it comes to training deep neural
networks with a large number of layers.

Â» The biggest problem is called Vanishing Gradient. That is, for a
deep network with many layers, when we update the weights using
backpropagation, the gradients transferred back to the earlier layers
get contracted exponentially. At some points, the updating gradients
almost vanish (become so close to 0), making the network unable to
learn any more.
